# write-tight

This project aims to make you a better business writer with the help of regular expressions. According to a [popular Udemy course on business writing][udemy] we should spend 50% of our writing time on post-writing. In this post-writing phase we make sure our documents are written as clear and concise as possible,
which is sometimes referred to as tight writing.

There are certain <em>patterns</em> in our writing which we want to avoid if we want to write tight. These are patterns that indicate 'deadwood'. According to the [book on tight writing][write-tight] deadwood is the unnecessarily difficult, long, or simply unnecessarily phrases or words that clog the arteries of professional writing. A few examples:

- Words that end on 'ly'
- Passive voice
- Subjunctive mood
- Ambiguous pronouns

Besides these patterns good business writing also adheres to a strict structure of your document. Each paragraph should start with a key sentence.
A key sentence needs to be short and clear, and should either be an assertion or a generality. A key sentence summarizes the entire paragraph and
should be enough for someone with little time to get the gist of the paragraph. The summary of your document are all key sentences combined.
