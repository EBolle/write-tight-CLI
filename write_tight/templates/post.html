            Ambiguous openings<br />
            There was, It were, It was. These sentence openings are vague. The
            more specific your writing, the more authority your document will
            have.

          <li class="ambiguous-pronouns">
            Ambiguous pronouns<br />
            It, these, those, and that are vague. The more precise your writing,
            the better.

          <li class="passive-voice">
            Passive voice<br />
            Was reading, is happening, are reading. A to be verb followed by a
            verb is an indicator of passive voice. Try to write 90% of your
            document in active voice.
          </li>
          <li class="subjunctive-mood">
            Subjunctive mood<br />
            Would of, should of, could of. Besides sounding weak, subjunctive
            mood can also suggest a condition when it is not present. This can
            cause confusion.
          </li>
          <li class="words-ending-with-ly">
            Words that end with ly<br />
            Basically, usually, normally. These words can <em>usually</em> be
            removed from your document without losing any meaning.
